// ArticleRequest is the request payload for Article data model.
//
// NOTE: It's good practice to have well defined request and response payloads
// so you can manage the specific inputs and outputs for clients, and also gives
// you the opportunity to transform data on input or output, for example
// on request, we'd like to protect certain fields and on output perhaps
// we'd like to include a computed field based on other values that aren't
// in the data model. Also, check out this awesome blog post on struct composition:

// swagger:route POST /article foobar-tag ArticleRequest
// Foobar does some amazing stuff.
// responses:
//   200: ArticleRequest
